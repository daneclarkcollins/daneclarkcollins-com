Come visit me at the 6th annual Jordancon on April 11-13. The event will be held at the Doubletree Hotel in Roswell.

I will be joining Michael Bielaczyc of Aradani Studios/Aradani Costumes for the launch of our new book, _[The Elves of Uteria](http://www.daneclarkcollins.com/world-of-uteria/the-elves-of-uteria/ "The Elves of Uteria")_. We will be throwing a launch party that spans two suites and will offer free booze, because Mike knows how to throw a party!

The book was cowritten by both Dane and Michael, and features Michael's incredible paint work on the cover.

Also at Jordancon will be several other artists from the book, including Sam Flegal, Paul Bielaczyc, Melissa Gay, and Larry Elmore.

We will be hosting a workshop on April 12 entitled "[Elves of Uteria: World Building](http://www.jordancon.org/sessions/elves-utera-world-building "Elves of Uteria: World Building")," where we will tell of our journey in creating the world, and will be answering questions from the audience.
