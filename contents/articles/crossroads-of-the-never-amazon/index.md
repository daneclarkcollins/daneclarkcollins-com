## Book description:

<img src="crossroads-cover.jpg">

For Toryn Ninefingers, this is much like any other night, entertaining a rowdy crowd with song and story. But tonight, he has a special purpose in the telling of his tale, and reveals a shocking personal story that he has never told an audience before. With its telling, Atheles may never be the same again.

This is the first book in the _Crossroads of the Never_ saga, a series spanning thousands of years, shedding light on the dark and disturbing mysteries of the world of Uteria—a world besieged by the passing of a dark age, the continuing echoes of its violent history, and the recent incursion of creatures long since forgotten.
