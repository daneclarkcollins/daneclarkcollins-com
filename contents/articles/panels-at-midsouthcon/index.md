MidSouthCon is March 20-22, 2015 in Memphis, TN. Most of the crew from Lone Wanderer Entertainment will be in attendance as author and artist guests, including myself.

This will be my first stop for promoting my new book, _Crossroads of the Never: Book 1_, which has just become available in both paperback and Kindle eBook formats through Sagaborn.com and Amazon.
