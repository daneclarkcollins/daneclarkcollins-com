Michael Bielaczyc has created an ambitious work of art which will be on display on the 10th, and it is accompanied by sounds so beautifully ugly that I have to be there to hear them.

I don't know exactly what dates yet, and will post them when I know exactly, but I'll be in Nashville the weekend of November 10th.

Mike's project is going to be a sight to behold, and I insist that everyone I know, even if you live in Sweden (you know who you are) make it out to help bear witness to this monumental display. If you know anyone in the media, they'll want to see this, so tell them to bring their cameras. Do NOT let them miss this tremendous opportunity for a Pulitzer Prize.

After the show we'll be drinking obscene amounts of alcohol in the nude and will gather atop the tower at Tiger Hill to partake in a world record breaking orgy. Guinness will be there to record the entire event.

The point is, it's going to be a weekend to remember, and if you don't make it, you're going to die wishing you hadn't lived such a dull and lonely life. Be there, that's all I'm saying.
