This story has been bouncing around my mind for years, but two Octobers ago, inspired by the anticipation of Halloween, I finally put words down. Now, the story is published.

## Description

A story of personal transformation gone terribly wrong.

Five friends stare at five golden chalices filled with mysterious elixirs. As they prepare to drink, they do not know what to expect, but they know that everything will be differentâ€”and in this world, different can only mean better.

Stan is the last to drink, and after watching his friends change, he refuses to drink from the fifth chalice. As his worst nightmares form before his eyes, he knows he must escape from his friends before he suffers their horrific fate.

## Purchase

The Fifth Chalice is available on Amazon.
