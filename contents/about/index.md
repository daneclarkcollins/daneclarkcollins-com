Dane is a speculative fiction writer deeply rooted in the stylings of classic literature. He was drawn to speculative fiction due to its ability to explore the human mind in reaction to the extraordinary.

Dane’s primary influences have been those who have managed to shape his mind in new and interesting ways. Those writers include Mervyn Peake, Aldous Huxley, Ursula K. Ke Guin, Philip K. Dick, Michael Moorcock, and Robert Anton Wilson, all of whom contributed to tearing down Dane’s various preexisting prejudices and beliefs.

Dane’s primary interest is in psychonautics: deep explorations of the mind. He is an avid reader of literature regarding psychology, neurology, memory, creativity, and mysticism.

## Dane’s Mission Statement

I am a writer not because I seek success, fame, or fortune (after all, writers, these days, make very little from the craft). I seek only to expand the minds of my readers.

I do not presume to have insights that make me superior to my readers, and therefore do not presume to enlighten. I merely use fiction as a vehicle to share my own personal insights in the hopes that they may be of some use to others on a similar journey.

In everything I write, I will take great care and deliberation to insure a positive and possibly illuminating experience for my readers. No word will be written without care, and most will contain multiple meanings. I promise that my writing will contain puzzles, so that the enjoyment of my writing does not necessarily have to end with the first reading of the final page. My stories will always be a vehicle for exploring larger themes.

I promise my readers to always do my best to entertain, while also attempting to stimulate thought and provide a new perspective from which to view life and the human condition.
