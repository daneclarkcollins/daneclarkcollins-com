For the past twenty years, since I first read [_The Scientist_](http://amzn.to/1WftfMM), John C. Lilly's account of his self-experimentation with sensory deprivation, I've wanted to experience a flotation tank. At the time, I knew of no opportunities to have this experience, but times have changed, and flotation chambers abound. So on April 9, 2016, I arrived at Float Flotation Therapy Center in Marlton, NJ, ready for my first time.

<span class="more"></span>

After I was checked in guided through what to expect, I went into the sauna for thirty minutes. This was just a bonus, but it was a relaxing start. Their sauna was a small room with modern electronic features like adjustable colored lights and a touch screen display where I could control media on Pandora, Netflix, and so on.

After thirty minutes, I went to my float room. Each float room has its own shower, so I started by taking one, then went into the flotation chamber and closed the door. The moment the door was sealed, I found myself in a new world.

It wasn’t what I’d expected. I was thinking this would be more of a small cylinder I’d slide into somehow, but instead, it was more like an enormous bathtub with a tall ceiling. There was lots of space. Like the sauna, the float chamber also had colored lights that I could adjust using a button on the side. Another button turned soft music on or off, which played through a speaker located under the water. I immediately turned off both the light and the music. They’re nice features, but I was there for the full sensory deprivation experience…or non-experience.

The water felt slippery and dense…though not in a sticky or gross way.  It was more comfortable than anything I’d felt before. It is kept at a precise temperature for the human body so that you never feel hot or cold. The water was a foot deep, and I worried that it might be too shallow, but it was more than enough. When I laid back, there was a bit of a shock as I began to float. I instinctively didn’t want to trust the water to hold me…but the density of the water makes it surprisingly buoyant. I laid my head back, relaxing completely, and expected my face to go under, but it didn’t. Once I was fully relaxed, I was fully afloat, and the water came to just above my ears, so that they were submerged, but there was no discomfort or worry about going under.

The water roiled a bit from my body stirring it, and I bounced around a bit. I ran into one wall, pushed off of it, went to the other after a few moments, and then realized this was too turbulent to work. So I reached out both arms and was just able to touch each side with my arms fully outstretched. I held myself stable for several moments while the water calmed, and then I just relaxed, with my arms still outstretched, but now simply floating. I touched nothing but water now, and found myself in perfect quiet, darkness, and stillness.

Finally, I was able to take in the experience. Deprived of my senses, I realized I may as well be floating in space…and with that thought, I was. I looked around, and there were no walls. There was nothing above or beneath me except the inky blackness of deep space. I understood, now, why this experience had been so apt to lead John Lilly and others to the experience of floating in space and, ultimately, of communicating with aliens.

At first, I was slightly disappointed in myself. I am a daily meditator. I’m much less a slave to my wandering and discursive thoughts than I once was. I had come into this with expectations. An hour and a half, floating in water, was bound to provide me with a breakthrough in my practice. And yet, as I lay there in this perfect quiet, my mind roamed as if agitated. To be clear, I felt no agitation, but apparently my mind did not realize that, and wandered from topic to topic.

I know that the worst way to tame a wandering mind is to attempt force, but I was feeling the clock ticking. I had ninety minutes to find the peace I was looking for in this experience, and that wasn’t going to happen if I didn’t calm my thoughts. So I forced my attention to my breathing…and immediately forgot. So I tried again…and forgot.

To be clear, I went in with nothing particularly on my mind, and even now, nothing in particular was on my mind. It was more like my mind was in revolt against this quiet, and neurons were firing in random directions, throwing assorted, disjoined thoughts into my consciousness.

I did manage some degree of meditative focus on my breath, even as the rest of my mind hopped around its chaotic obstacle course, but the disappointment remained. If this experience was wasted, it would not be an indictment of the flotation device itself, but my own.

Then, a voice spoke to me from within: “Trust.” _What? Did I think that?_ I wasn’t sure. I did not seem so, and yet, there it was. Trust. Trust what?

As I scanned my environment and my body with my mind, I understood. Despite my relaxation, some part of me was rebelling against allowing this water to hold me aloft while I had no sensation of the world around me. Lacking any stimulus for the first time in my life, my mind was reaching out, searching. “Trust,” the word came again, and suddenly, I found a new level of relaxation, both physically and mentally. I trusted the water, the warmth, the darkness, the silence.

I had transcended that turbulent mind, and the chamber became much quieter now that my mind had ceased filling it with noise. It had taken some time, but now, here I was.

I turned my attention to my breathing again. I realized I could hear everything…every nuance of sound in my breath, subtle bodily sounds, my heartbeat. This was new. Sure, I’d heard these sounds before, but never like this. Never in this moment. In fact, every moment was new. Every moment was novel and interesting, if only I would pay attention. So I did pay attention, each moment dissolving into the next, and each moment amazing and interesting.

I had found another moment that had transcended the last. I had reached some new level of ascendence, I realized, and I wondered how many levels I would find before reaching the uppermost level…or was there a limit?

I wondered if this was merely a conceptual framework I was imposing, but it didn’t change the fact of the experience: my mind had never been in this state, and with each level of transcendence, I was in a palpably different state of mind.

But this, in itself, was merely the thinking of an illusory self, wasn’t it? And with that thought, I stepped outside that illusory self, and I looked at it. This was the self I had spent my life knowing, loving, and allowing myself to be lost within…but it was merely a device: a thing to carry around this bit of my consciousness so that the organism supporting me could survive. It was useful, and I needed it, but it wasn’t me…at least, not completely.

Another level of transcendence.

But it pulled me back into it, and I forgot for a moment that I was not entirely this self. My mind wandered…not in the fitful way that it had early in my float, but somewhat aimlessly nonetheless. Perhaps I needed this break. When I returned to my breathing and the present moment, however, I found myself a little frustrated, as if I’d almost found some profound enlightenment, but had let myself get pulled back into the ego.

“Trust.” The word came again. _I do trust_, I replied. I trusted the water. I trusted the experience. The voice wanted something more. I understood, then, although my effort to put it into words failed. Trust the Universe? Those words were far too impersonal. Trust God? I’m not a believer, and this wasn’t an urging to trust something outside of myself. Trust myself? This implies the ego self.

So I just settled on the single word trust, and I found myself in a new level of transcendence. I felt an itch, but I didn’t scratch it, for I trusted that it was impermanent—and it was. I became slightly restless, but I trusted this would pass—and it did. I trusted these distractions, mind wandering, and discomforts were part of the journey—and they were. I trusted that every moment in my life had led me to this one, and that every moment going forward would lead me to where I needed to go. I trusted that I deserved every comfort life gave me, and that every moment of suffering would be not only endured, but transcended, as long I continued to trust.

I had transcended again, and I was satisfied. I let my mind wander, because that was okay. I trusted it to go where it needed, and I trusted myself to find my way back.

After a while, I realized I had to be over on time. Had I been forgotten? Had they closed for the night and gone home? I decided that, even if the float wasn’t over, it was time to return to the world. I sat up and turned the light on: it was soft and blue, and my eyes were pointed only to its reflection in the water, and yet it was as shocking as if I’d looked directly at the sun. After a moment, my eyes adjusted.

I decided, now, to play rather than to emerge immediately. I laid back into the water, and I turned the soft music on. I stared at the ceiling, now illuminated, and realized I was now more relaxed than at any point in my life. My mind did not churn. I was happy. And I was moving more than I’d realized in the darkness, from one side to the other. I let myself go to one side, then, very gently, pushed with my finger, and floated to the other. The music faded, and I realized I’d drifted to the bottom, so l let me toe touch, pushed myself off gently, and listened to the music slowly grow in volume as I drifted to the top over the course of a minute or so.

I sat backup, opened the door, stepped out carefully into the shower, and turned it on. I had to wash twice to get all of the salt off of me.

I dressed, stepped out, and found myself alone in the hallway. I walked to the back room, where they have chairs setup so people can relax and reflect after the float. I sat in a chair and opened the two books they have next to the table. One has sketches from people just after their floats, and the other has writings. As I flipped through the writings, I found that the profundity of my experience was far from unique.

I closed the book and walked out to find John, the man working that night, sitting with two other men who had just emerged. I found that I had no words, so I stood there quietly. The two men left, and John asked how it was. My voice came out strangely deep and quiet. I couldn’t, I realized, talk as quickly as I normally did. My mind had slowed tremendously. I wondered if I was being weird, but he talked at my speed and asked questions about my float with genuine curiosity. I realized that his nights are probably filled with people emerging from those tanks and expressing their own revelations. If I was being weird, it was in a way that he was surely used to.

Floats will be a part of my life from now on. I have to explore further. I now fully understand and share John Lilly’s fascination with the experience, and there's more work to be done.
